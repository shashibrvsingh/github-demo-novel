The Valley of Ashes, a desolate wasteland located between West Egg and New York City, serves as a symbol of the moral and spiritual decay that lurks beneath the surface of American society. It is here that the consequences of the characters' actions come to fruition, as the lives of the working class are crushed beneath the weight of the wealthy elite's indifference. The juxtaposition of the Valley of Ashes with the opulence of West Egg and East Egg serves as a stark reminder of the inequality and injustice that pervade American society.
